## üåü About This Project

> This portfolio is more than just a digital resume; it's a testament to my passion for development and my belief in creating memorable user experiences. It was built from the ground up to be an interactive playground, blending a modern "Glassmorphism" aesthetic with fluid animations and user-centric features. The goal was to build a professional platform that not only lists my skills but actively demonstrates my attention to detail and technical capabilities.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This portfolio is packed with modern and interactive features designed to create an engaging experience:

*   **üé® Dual-Theme System:** A sleek theme switcher allows users to toggle between a glowing **Dark Mode** and a crisp, professional **Light Mode**. The user's preference is automatically saved in their browser for future visits.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Custom Interactive Cursor:** A bespoke cursor provides instant visual feedback, transforming its appearance when hovering over links, buttons, and other interactive elements.
*   **‚ú® Interactive 3D Skill Cards:** Skill cards feature a subtle 3D parallax tilt effect (**Vanilla-Tilt.js**), making the skills section more dynamic and fun to explore.
*   **‚úíÔ∏è Dual Typing Animations:**
    *   A welcoming animation in the navbar cycles through multilingual greetings before settling on my name.
    *   A dynamic title effect in the hero section showcases my different roles and specializations.
*   **üöÄ Smooth Scroll-Reveal Animations:** Every section gracefully fades and slides into view as the user scrolls, creating a smooth, narrative-driven browsing experience.
*   **üìà Animated Timelines:** The timeline's connecting line animates as it enters the viewport, visually guiding the user through my professional and educational journey.
*   **üì± Meticulously Responsive Design:** The layout is crafted to ensure a flawless and intuitive experience on all devices, from mobile phones to high-resolution desktops.
